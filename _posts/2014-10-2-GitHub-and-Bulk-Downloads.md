## Data Decisions
Andrew taught a useful tutorial on GitHub, which allows people to collaborate on code and projects easily.  There's a decently steep learning curve, though it's helpful that the staff at the incubator are always nearby.  After setting up and working through the main commands on GitHub, Andrew and I discussed how and where to store the patent data.  Rather than putting it on Amazon, we decided to use a cluster in the Computer Science Department at UW.  Since the zip files are relatively small and the cluster has 24 cores, we decided that this is a better location for the project.  Onto processing the XML next week!
