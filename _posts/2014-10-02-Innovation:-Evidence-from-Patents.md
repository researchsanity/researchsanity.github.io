## Innovation: Evidence from Patents
Technological innovation is one of the key drivers of long-term economic growth studied in economics and finance, yet our proxies for innovation remain coarse.  The most common proxy for innovation is patent data.  Patents provide researchers with a clear and well-recorded measure of innovation, where the number of patents and patent citations are argued to quantify the scale and novelty of a companyâ€™s innovation, respectively.  While these data offer academics a particular measurement of patents, they do not include
many of the sub-fields and information contained in patents.  Over the next 10 weeks and as part of the Data Science Incubation Program, I hope to extend and explore the data contained in patent files.  My [GitHub wiki page] (https://github.com/uwescience/incubator/wiki/patent-analysis) has more details.

Today, I worked with Bill on how and where to host the data.  Grant data on patents from 1976 to today consumes about 4TB of disk space.  I learned how to set-up and begin an instance on Amazon Web Services, using EC2.  We edited Python that Andrew started to download the data in bulk from Google.
